OLC - On-Line Creation

This module is the core of the Evennia online creation helper system.
This is a resource intended for players with build privileges.

While the OLC command can be used to start the OLC "from the top", the
system is also intended to be plugged in to enhance existing build commands
with a more menu-like building style.

Functionality:

- Prototype management: Allows to create and edit Prototype
dictionaries. Can store such Prototypes on the Builder Player as an Attribute
or centrally on a central store that all builders can fetch prototypes from.
- Creates a new entity either from an existing prototype or by creating the
prototype on the fly for the sake of that single object (the prototype can
then also be saved for future use).
- Recording of session, for performing a series of recorded build actions in sequence.
Stored so as to be possible to reproduce.
- Export of objects created in recording mode to a batchcode file (Immortals only).
