## Creating an Issue

Thanks for helping us improve Evennia! 

## Making an issue:

Issues are formatted using [markdown][7]. Here is some useful markdown syntax:

   - \**italic text*\* 
   - \*\***bold text**\*\* 
   - \[link text\]\(url\)
   - \``inline code`\` 
   - \`\`\````multiline code```\`\`\`

Please use \``@command`\` when you mention Evennia in-game commands
starting with `@`. Otherwise github will notify any github-user that
happens to be named *command*.  If you need further help, see the [Get
and Give help][4] page and [www.evennia.com][1] for access to all
things Evennia.
