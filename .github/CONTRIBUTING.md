Thanks for helping us improve Evennia! 

## Making an issue (bug report / feature request):

Issues are formatted using [markdown][7]. There is already a
template to fill in. Here is some useful markdown syntax:

   - \**italic text*\* 
   - \*\***bold text**\*\* 
   - \[link text\]\(url\)
   - \``inline code`\` 
   - \`\`\````multiline code```\`\`\`

Please use \``@command`\` when you mention Evennia in-game commands
starting with `@`. Otherwise github will notify any github-user that
happens to be named *command!*

If you need further help, see the [Get and Give help][4] page and
[www.evennia.com][1] for access to all things Evennia.

## Making a Pull request (PR)

- All contributions should abide by Evennia's [style guide](https://github.com/evennia/evennia/blob/master/CODING_STYLE.md).
- Work in your own Github *fork*. For your own sanity and ours, separate unrelated contributions into separate branches and make a new Push request (PR) for each. You can still update the branch after the PR is up. 
- Read the [Contribution][3] page for more help.
